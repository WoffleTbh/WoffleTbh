I do coding sometimes I guess...

I mostly work with Python, but I have expierence with C++, Lua and JavaScript.

I also have quite a bit of expierence with brainfuck, as esoteric programming language.

Here's an if statement in brainfuck:
```brainfuck
++++++++++>               Number 1
++++++++++>               Number 2

+<<[->-<]>[>-<[-]]>[-
  Any code in here will run if Cell 1 and Cell 2 are the same
]
```
